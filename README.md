Information technology has the potential to significantly improve healthcare quality by enhancing efficiency, improving patient safety outcomes, and reducing overall costs.  Health informatics combines computer science, clinical knowledge, management, and information technology. The quality of care has many different aspects including safety, timeliness, equity, and most importantly effectiveness. Adapting to the health informatics technologies will decrease medical errors and increase patient satisfaction while also easing clinical workflow. The use of technology in the healthcare sector is crucial moving forward to accommodate the rapid growth in clinical data. This data can be used to improve public healthcare utilization to achieve optimal quality of care.  By optimizing workflows, initiating preventative and chronic disease managment, and utilizing teleheatlh/remote monitoring, health informatics can also reduce costs.
